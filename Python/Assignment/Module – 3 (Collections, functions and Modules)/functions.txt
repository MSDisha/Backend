How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?  
Built-in Functions:
 functions that are pre-defined in Python and can be used directly without the need for any imports. Examples include print(), len(), sum(), max(), min(), and type().

User-defined Functions:
functions that you create yourself to perform specific tasks. They are defined using the def keyword. Example:

These are small functions defined using the lambda keyword. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.Example:
