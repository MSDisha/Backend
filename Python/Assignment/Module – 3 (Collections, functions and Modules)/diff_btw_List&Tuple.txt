 What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.  
A tuple is a built-in data structure in Python that is similar to a list, but it is immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified (i.e., you cannot add, remove, or change the elements). Tuples are defined by placing a comma-separated sequence of values within parentheses ().

List:
Mutable (can be modified)	
Defined with square brackets []	
Used when you need a collection of items that can change

Tuple:
Immutable (cannot be modified)
Defined with parentheses ()
Used when you want a fixed collection of items
